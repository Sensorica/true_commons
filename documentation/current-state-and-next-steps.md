# Project Analysis and Next Steps

This document provides an analysis of the current state of the True Commons project and proposes a sequence for the next development steps. It is based on a review of the code and the developer documentation.

## Current State Analysis

The project has a solid foundation with SvelteKit, TypeScript, and hREA, but the implementation of core features is in its early stages. The existing documentation in `status.md` and `work-in-progress.md` appears to be aspirational and does not reflect the current reality of the codebase.

### 1. Core Foundation
- **‚úÖ Foundation Initialization**: The initialization of core hREA concepts (Units, Actions, etc.) through the `foundation.service.svelte.ts` is working. This is a critical first step.

### 2. Agent Management
- **‚ö†Ô∏è `myAgent` Implementation**: The current method for identifying the logged-in user (`myAgent`) relies on `localStorage`. This is a temporary workaround. The `graphql-developer-docs/using-myagent.md` documentation outlines the correct approach using the `myAgent` GraphQL query and the `associateMyAgent` mutation. This is a **blocker** for most other functionality, as a stable user identity is required for all resource and event creation.
- **üêû Agent Editing**: The user has reported that editing agent profiles is buggy.

### 3. hREA Modules (Resources, Events, Processes, Intents, Commitments)
- **UI is Ready**: The Svelte UI components and pages for these modules are largely in place (`/resources`, `/events`, etc.). This provides a great starting point.
- **Functionality is Missing**: The UI is not yet connected to the underlying Svelte stores and GraphQL services. For example, the resource creation form does not yet call the `resourcesStore.createResource` function. The stores themselves (`resources.store.svelte.ts`, etc.) have the necessary logic to interact with hREA, but this logic is not yet invoked by the UI.

### 4. Documentation
- **Outdated**: The main status documents (`status.md`, `work-in-progress.md`) describe a nearly complete project, which is not accurate. They should be updated to reflect the actual progress after the features are implemented.

## Proposed Next Steps

Here is a recommended order of operations to build out the application's functionality.

### Priority 1: Solidify Agent Management
This is the most critical next step, as agent identity is fundamental.

1.  **Refactor `myAgent` Handling**:
    -   In `agents.store.svelte.ts`, remove the reliance on `localStorage` for `myAgent`.
    -   Implement the flow described in `using-myagent.md`:
        1.  On startup, call the `myAgent` GraphQL query.
        2.  If it returns `null`, the user is not associated with an agent.
        3.  After a user creates a new agent (`createPerson`), call the `associateMyAgent` mutation to link the new agent record to the user's session.
        4.  The `myAgent` query should then return the correct agent data.
2.  **Debug Agent Editing**:
    -   Investigate and fix the bugs in the agent profile editing functionality.

### Priority 2: Implement Resource Management
With agent identity resolved, we can move on to the core ValueFlows modules. Resources are a good starting point.

1.  **Wire up Resource Creation**:
    -   Connect the `ResourceCreateForm.svelte` component to the `resourcesStore.createResource` method.
    -   The `createResource` method in the store already contains the correct hREA logic (create a `ResourceSpecification` then a "produce" `EconomicEvent`). This logic needs to be triggered from the UI.
2.  **Display Resources**:
    -   Ensure the `ResourcesCanvas.svelte` component correctly displays the list of `EconomicResource` objects from the `resourcesStore`.
    -   Verify that searching and filtering on the `/resources` page works as expected.

### Priority 3: Implement Remaining hREA Modules
Once resources are working, the same pattern can be applied to the other modules in a logical sequence. A recommended order is:

1.  **Economic Events**: Wire up the UI to create and display events.
2.  **Processes**: Implement creation and display of processes and process specifications. Link events to processes.
3.  **Intents**: Implement the planning layer by allowing users to create and view intents.
4.  **Commitments**: Complete the planning layer by implementing commitments that can satisfy intents.

For each module, the work involves:
-   Connecting the existing Svelte UI component (e.g., `CommitmentCreateForm.svelte`) to the corresponding store method (e.g., `commitmentsStore.createCommitment`).
-   Ensuring the data is displayed correctly on the module's page (e.g., `/commitments`).

### Priority 4: Update Documentation
Once significant progress has been made on the features above, the project documentation should be updated.

1.  **Update `status.md`**: Revise the "What is Working" and "What is Not Yet Implemented" sections to accurately reflect the state of the application.
2.  **Update `work-in-progress.md`**: Update the phases and next steps to show what has been completed and what is planned next.

By following this plan, we can systematically build out the application's features on top of the existing foundation.
