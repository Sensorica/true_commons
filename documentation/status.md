## What is Not Yet Implemented

### ❌ Commitments and Intents (Phase 4 - NOT STARTED)
- **Type Definitions**: No Commitment or Intent types defined
- **Store Layer**: No stores for commitments and intents
- **UI Components**: No forms or management interfaces for commitments and intents
- **Navigation**: No routes for `/commitments` or `/intents`
- **Integration**: No linking between commitments, intents, and existing processes/events
- **Planning Layer**: No planning workflows or satisfaction tracking

### ❌ Advanced Network Features (Phase 5 - NOT STARTED)
- **Agreement Management**: No agreement types or flows
- **Claims and Evidence**: No claims tracking or evidence management
- **Proposal Management**: No proposal workflows
- **Advanced Resource Tracking**: Limited resource tracking capabilities
- **Network Coordination**: No network-level coordination features

## Current Capabilities

### ✅ What Users Can Do
1. **Foundation Management**: Initialize and manage foundation components (units, actions, agents, resource specifications)
2. **Resource Management**: Create, view, and manage digital resources with proper validation
3. **Event Tracking**: Create and manage economic events with full validation and process linking
4. **Process Management**: Create and manage processes and process specifications
5. **Agent Management**: Create and manage agent profiles with authentication
6. **Dashboard Overview**: View comprehensive statistics and recent activity across all components

### ✅ Working Features
- **Foundation Validation**: All operations validate foundation dependencies
- **Real-time Updates**: Reactive state management with immediate UI updates
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages and graceful fallbacks
- **Navigation**: Complete navigation with proper routing and responsive design
- **Data Persistence**: Proper state management with localStorage integration
- **Demo Mode**: Functional demo mode with comprehensive mock data

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Foundation Components ✅ 100%

- Comprehensive validation and error handling
- One-click initialization with progress tracking

### Phase 2: Economic Events ✅ 100%
- Full CRUD operations implemented
- Complete validation and foundation integration
- UI components and forms fully functional

### Phase 3: Processes ✅ 100%
- Process and ProcessSpecification management complete
- Full integration with economic events
- Comprehensive UI with tabbed management interface

### Phase 4: Commitments and Intents ❌ 0%
- No implementation started
- Requires type definitions, stores, UI components, and navigation

### Phase 5: Advanced Features ❌ 0%
- No implementation started
- Dependent on completion of Phase 4

## Technical Architecture Status

### ✅ Working Components
- **SvelteKit 5**: Modern frontend framework with TypeScript
- **hREA GraphQL**: ValueFlows implementation with proper schema

## Conclusion

The project has made significant progress beyond the initial PoC phase. The foundation is solid with comprehensive validation, error handling, and user experience. The next major milestone is implementing Phase 4 (Commitments and Intents) to add planning capabilities to the ValueFlows implementation.

The architecture is well-designed and ready for the next phase of development, following the proper ValueFlows implementation sequence as outlined in the Implementation-sequence.md document.
