# Implementation Status

> **Note**: The project is currently a **Proof of Concept (PoC)**. The status below reflects the current state of this evolving implementation.

This document provides a snapshot of the current state of the True Commons project as of the last update.

## What is Working

### ‚úÖ Foundation Components (Phase 1 - Partially Completed)
- **Units of Measure**: Store implementation with initialization and default units.
- **Actions**: Action management with default ValueFlows actions.
- **Resource Specifications**: Resource specification management with default types.
- **Foundation Service**: Basic integration layer for dependency validation.

### ‚úÖ Frontend Infrastructure
- **Modern UI**: SvelteKit 5-based user interface with TypeScript.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface with Tailwind CSS styling.
- **Component Scaffolding**: UI components and pages for most hREA modules are in place but not yet functional.
- **State Management**: Svelte 5 stores created for hREA modules.

### ‚úÖ Backend Integration (Partially Working)
- **hREA Integration**: Successfully connects to the hREA GraphQL service.
- **Apollo Client**: Properly configured.

## What is Not Yet Implemented

### üü° Agent Management (In Progress, Blocked)
- **`myAgent` Handling**: The current implementation uses `localStorage` as a temporary workaround. This needs to be refactored to use the proper `myAgent` GraphQL query and `associateMyAgent` mutation. **This is a blocker for other features.**
- **Agent Editing**: The agent profile editing functionality is reported as buggy.

### ‚ùå Resource Management (Not Started)
- The UI is not yet connected to the `resourcesStore` to perform CRUD operations.
- The logic for creating resources via `EconomicEvents` is in the store but not yet used.

### ‚ùå Economic Events (Not Started)
- The UI is not yet connected to the `economicEventsStore` to perform CRUD operations.

### ‚ùå Processes (Not Started)
- The UI is not yet connected to the stores to manage Processes and Process Specifications.
- Linking events to processes is not implemented.

### ‚ùå Commitments and Intents (Not Started)
- The entire planning layer (Commitments and Intents) is not yet implemented. The UI and stores are scaffolds.

### ‚ùå Advanced Network Features (Not Started)
- **Agreement Management**: No agreement types or flows.
- **Claims and Evidence**: No claims tracking or evidence management.
- **Proposal Management**: No proposal workflows.

## Current Capabilities

### ‚úÖ What Users Can Do
1. **View the UI**: Users can navigate the application and see the placeholder pages for different features.
2. **Initialize Foundation**: The basic foundation components (Units, Actions, etc.) can be initialized.
3. **Create an Agent (with caveats)**: A user can create an agent, but the association with the current session is not handled correctly.

### ‚ùå What Users Cannot Do (Yet)
- Reliably identify themselves in the application (`myAgent`).
- Create or manage Resources, Events, Processes, Intents, or Commitments.
- See their activity reflected in the dashboard or other UI elements.

## Next Steps

The next steps are outlined in `documentation/current-state-and-next-steps.md` and `documentation/work-in-progress.md`. The immediate priorities are:
1.  **Fix `myAgent` implementation.**
2.  **Fix Agent editing bugs.**
3.  **Implement full CRUD functionality for Resource Management.**
4.  Implement functionality for the remaining hREA modules in sequence.
