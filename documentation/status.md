# Implementation Status

> **Note**: The project is currently a **Proof of Concept (PoC)**. The status below reflects the state of this demonstration, not a production-ready application.

This document provides a snapshot of the current state of the True Commons project as of the last update.

## What is Working

-   **Modern UI (`ui/`)**: The SvelteKit-based user interface is functional and serves as the primary entry point for the PoC.
    -   It successfully simulates a connection to a Holochain backend via a GraphQL service.
    -   It displays a "Network Overview" dashboard with key metrics (Total Agents, Resources, Events).
    -   It can fetch and display lists of agents and resources from the mock data source.
-   **Backend Connection**: The architectural pattern for connecting the UI, a GraphQL service, and the Holochain conductor is established and demonstrated.
-   **Demo Mode**: The UI includes a robust "demo mode" that allows it to function with mock data. **This is the only active mode in the PoC.**

## Remaining Tasks

-   **Backend Integration**: The primary remaining task is to fully implement and integrate the Holochain DNA and GraphQL service, replacing the mock data with live data.
-   **Full CRUD Functionality**: While the UI can read data, most of the "Create", "Update", and "Delete" functionalities for resources, agents, and events still need to be fully implemented and wired up to a live backend.
-   **Feature Parity**: Not all features from the `ui_old` application have been ported to the new `ui`. A thorough review and migration plan is needed.
-   **Advanced hREA Features**: The current implementation only uses a subset of the hREA capabilities. More complex features like `Processes`, `Plans`, and `Commitments` are not yet utilized in the UI.
-   **Testing**: A comprehensive testing suite (unit, integration, and end-to-end) needs to be established for the `ui` application.

## Known Issues

-   There are no known critical bugs at this time. However, the application is still in an early development phase, and comprehensive testing has not yet been performed.
