# Use Case: Collaboration at Sensorica

Sensorica is a network-type organization that practices commons-based peer producton, or simply peer production. Agents within the Sensorica network aggregate or organize around shared goals. Since the network is focused on hardware development, we can say that Agents organize around a shared Resource, which represents the Deliverable of their collaborative activities. Let's say that this deliverable is a new electronic device. The shared digital commons in this case would be all the information about how this device is made, how to make it, how to use it, etc. The Resource, or the digital commons is not the thing itself, it is everything one needs to know in orer to produce and use it. So the digital asset, a True Commons, is a bundle of documents, computer programs, CAD files, electronic design files, etc. 
In order for these Agents to achieve their goal, to create this hardware device that is represented by this digital asset, they need to use other Resources, in Processes. Some of these Resources that they use may also be True Commons. Others may be materials, money and other such things.

These Agents that collaborate on this hardware device defacto form an organization, an association. We can all this organization a **Project** or a **Venture**. In order to support these organizations that are formed around a True Commons as a deliverable or shared goal of Agents, we need to provide a **collaborative and stigmergic digital environment**.

A concrete use case illustrates the need for a stigmergic environment. In Ventures that are nested within the Sensorica network contributors (Agents) work in separate "activity bubbles":

-   **Anthony (Development)**: Works on hardware design, logs time and purchases, and creates digital assets (CAD files, reports).
-   **Kampesin (Outreach)**: Produces content for outreach, using development reports to create blog posts.
-   **Mayssam (Financing)**: Writes funding proposals, using development reports and past proposals as source material.

Currently, a project coordinator (Tibi) must manually create bridges between these bubbles by:
1.  **Mapping**: Manually identifying relationships between activities (e.g., a new development report can be used for a funding proposal).
2.  **Signaling**: Manually posting messages on Discord, tagging relevant people to draw their attention to new resources or opportunities.

This manual coordination is a bottleneck. The ideal digital environment would make these maps and signals an intrinsic part of the workspace, allowing contributors to discover these connections organically.

## User Stories & High-Level Features

This section outlines the primary functionalities from a user's perspective, organized by the core backend requirements derived from the Sensorica use case.

## Agent Identity & Profile Management

**Primary Backend Requirement**: Multi-agent identity system supporting various contributor types.

-   **As Anthony (developer)**, I want to create a profile that showcases my technical skills and development contributions, so that others can understand my expertise and past work.
-   **As Kampesin (outreach coordinator)**, I want to create a profile that highlights my communication skills and outreach experience, so that I can be identified for content creation opportunities.
-   **As Mayssam (financing specialist)**, I want to create a profile that demonstrates my fundraising experience and proposal writing skills, so that I can be matched with financing opportunities.
-   **As Tibi (project coordinator)**, I want to view comprehensive profiles of all contributors to understand their capabilities and availability for coordination purposes.

## Resource Creation & Management

**Primary Backend Requirement**: Multi-format digital resource management with proper versioning and attribution.

-   **As Anthony**, I want to upload CAD files, technical reports, and hardware specifications as digital resources, so that they can be accessed by other contributors and used in derivative works.
-   **As Kampesin**, I want to create blog posts and outreach materials that reference Anthony's technical resources, so that I can build upon existing development work.
-   **As Mayssam**, I want to create funding proposals that incorporate both Anthony's technical reports and Kampesin's outreach materials, so that I can create comprehensive funding applications.
-   **As any contributor**, I want to be able to fork/derivative resources created by others, so that I can build upon existing work while maintaining attribution.

## Economic Event Tracking & Contribution Recording

**Primary Backend Requirement**: Comprehensive activity logging that captures all forms of contribution.

-   **As Anthony**, I want to log my development time, material purchases, and resource creation activities, so that my contributions are properly tracked and attributed.
-   **As Kampesin**, I want to log my time spent on content creation, outreach activities, and community engagement, so that my non-technical contributions are valued.
-   **As Mayssam**, I want to log time spent on proposal writing, funding applications, and financial planning, so that my strategic contributions are recognized.
-   **As any contributor**, I want to see a complete history of all contributions across the venture, so that I can understand the full scope of work and identify opportunities for collaboration.

## Process & Workflow Management

**Primary Backend Requirement**: Structured workflow representation that captures cross-functional dependencies.

-   **As Anthony**, I want to create development processes that specify what inputs I need and what outputs I will create, so that others can understand how to collaborate with my work.
-   **As Kampesin**, I want to create outreach processes that show how I transform technical documentation into public-facing content, so that the value chain is transparent.
-   **As Mayssam**, I want to create financing processes that demonstrate how I combine technical and outreach materials into funding proposals, so that the collaborative nature of the work is clear.
-   **As Tibi**, I want to see all processes across the venture and understand their interdependencies, so that I can optimize coordination and identify bottlenecks.

## Intent & Commitment Coordination

**Primary Backend Requirement**: Decentralized coordination mechanism that eliminates the need for manual project management.

-   **As Anthony**, I want to express my intentions for future development work, so that others can plan their activities around my outputs.
-   **As Kampesin**, I want to express my intentions to create content based on Anthony's upcoming development work, so that I can coordinate my timeline with his.
-   **As Mayssam**, I want to express my intentions to create funding proposals when sufficient technical and outreach materials are available, so that I can coordinate my work with both Anthony and Kampesin.
-   **As any contributor**, I want to make commitments to deliver specific outputs by certain dates, so that others can depend on my work for their own planning.

## Automatic Relationship Discovery

**Primary Backend Requirement**: Graph-based relationship mapping that identifies cross-functional opportunities.

-   **As Anthony**, I want the system to automatically notify relevant contributors when I create new technical resources, so that they can incorporate my work into their activities.
-   **As Kampesin**, I want the system to automatically identify technical resources that would be suitable for outreach content, so that I can discover opportunities without manual coordination.
-   **As Mayssam**, I want the system to automatically identify when sufficient materials are available for funding proposals, so that I can act on opportunities without waiting for manual notifications.
-   **As Tibi**, I want the system to automatically map relationships between resources, contributors, and activities, so that I can focus on high-level coordination rather than manual mapping.

## Contribution Validation & Peer Review

**Primary Backend Requirement**: Decentralized quality control and validation mechanisms.

-   **As Anthony**, I want my technical contributions to be reviewed by other technical contributors, so that quality is maintained without centralized control.
-   **As Kampesin**, I want my outreach materials to be reviewed by the community, so that they accurately represent the venture's work and values.
-   **As Mayssam**, I want my funding proposals to be reviewed by both technical and outreach contributors, so that they are comprehensive and accurate.
