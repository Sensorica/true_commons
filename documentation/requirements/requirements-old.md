# Project Requirements

## 1. Vision & Goals

The True Commons platform is designed to enable the creation and management of decentralized, organization-agnostic digital assets, which are considered Resources in the Valueflows language. The core goal of this **Proof of Concept (PoC)** is to demonstrate the key features and architectural patterns required to achieve this vision.

# About UX / UI

## 2. Core Concepts: Stigmergic Collaboration

The primary goal of the UI/UX is to move beyond traditional dashboards and spreadsheets to create a **stigmergic digital environment**. Stigmergy is a mechanism of indirect coordination where the trace left in the environment by an action stimulates the performance of a next action. The environment itself, filled with signals and artifacts, should guide users' collaboration.

### 2.1. Stigmergic Environment Requirements

-   **Navigation**: The environment must allow users to freely navigate contexts of work, zoom out to see the bigger picture, and dive back into specifics, similar to a digital whiteboard like Miro. This breaks the linear, one-dimensional constraint of traditional documents and dashboards.
-   **Permissive Structure**: The environment must be highly permissive, allowing any user to contribute to its structure and content (e.g., adding notes, embedding media, linking items).
-   **Signaling (Digital Pheromones)**: Users must be able to place various signals to communicate status, priority, or calls to action. This includes comments, tags, color-coding, or other graphical symbols that let others know what has been done, what is happening, and what can be done next.
-   **Interoperability**: The environment should support building bridges between different contexts or even different organizational networks, allowing for the flow of agents, resources, and visibility between them.

-   Backend performance will be sufficient to support real-time collaboration and notification systems.
-   The implementation follows the proper ValueFlows implementation sequence and maintains compatibility with existing tools.
-   Foundation components (Units, Actions, Agents, Resource Specifications) must be properly initialized before other operations can be performed.
-   The coordination mechanisms will be sufficiently automated to eliminate the need for dedicated project coordinators in most cases.
