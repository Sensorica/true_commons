# True Commons Work in Progress

## Implementation Phases Status

### Phase 1: Foundation and Agent Management (IN PROGRESS)
- ✅ **Status**: Partially Completed
- ✅ Units of Measure (with store, initialization, and validation)
- ✅ Actions (with store, default actions, and validation)
- 🟡 Agents (store created, but `myAgent` relies on localStorage and editing is buggy)
- ✅ Resource Specifications (with store and default specifications)
- ✅ Foundation Service (initial version integrated)
- ✅ Basic UI Components and Navigation

### Phase 2: Resource Management (❌ NOT STARTED)
- ❌ **Status**: NOT STARTED
- ❌ **EconomicResource** types and data structures
- ❌ Store methods for full CRUD operations
- ❌ UI components for resource creation and display wired to store
- ❌ Integration with Economic Events for resource creation (produce events)

### Phase 3: Economic Events (❌ NOT STARTED)
- ❌ **Status**: NOT STARTED
- ❌ UI components for event creation and display wired to store
- ❌ Full CRUD operations for events with error handling
- ❌ Dashboard integration with event statistics

### Phase 4: Processes (❌ NOT STARTED)
- ❌ **Status**: NOT STARTED
- ❌ Process and ProcessSpecification types with complete ValueFlows fields
- ❌ GraphQL queries and mutations for processes and specifications
- ❌ Process and ProcessSpecification stores
- ❌ UI Components for creation and display wired to stores
- ❌ EconomicEvents integration with processes (input/output linking)

### Phase 5: Commitments and Intents (❌ NOT STARTED)
- ❌ **Status**: NOT STARTED
- ❌ Commitment and Intent types and data structures
- ❌ Planning layer integration
- ❌ Commitment and Intent stores
- ❌ UI components for creation and display wired to stores
- ❌ Satisfaction tracking (commitments satisfy intents)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priority: Solidify Agent Management (Phase 1)
1.  **Refactor `myAgent` Handling**:
    -   In `agents.store.svelte.ts`, remove the reliance on `localStorage` for `myAgent`.
    -   Implement the correct hREA flow: `myAgent` query -> `createPerson` -> `associateMyAgent` mutation.
2.  **Debug Agent Editing**:
    -   Investigate and fix the bugs in the agent profile editing functionality.

### Priority 2: Implement Resource Management (Phase 2)
1.  **Wire up Resource Creation**:
    -   Connect the `ResourceCreateForm.svelte` component to the `resourcesStore.createResource` method.
    -   Ensure the underlying hREA logic (create `ResourceSpecification` -> create produce `EconomicEvent`) is triggered correctly.
2.  **Display Resources**:
    -   Wire up the `ResourcesCanvas.svelte` to display the list of resources from the store.
    -   Ensure search and filtering functions work correctly.

### Priority 3: Implement Remaining hREA Modules (Phases 3-5)
Once resources are working, apply the same pattern to the other modules in the following order:
1.  **Economic Events**: Wire up UI to create and display events.
2.  **Processes**: Implement creation and display of processes. Link events to processes.
3.  **Intents**: Implement UI for creating and viewing intents.
4.  **Commitments**: Implement UI for creating and managing commitments.

### Priority 4: Update Documentation
- As features are implemented, update `status.md` and this document to reflect the actual progress.
