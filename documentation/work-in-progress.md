# Work in Progress

## Current Focus: Documentation Refinement

The current development effort is focused on refining the project's foundational documentation based on the detailed co-creation document provided (`True commons & new digital environments that can support stygmergic collaboration`).

This update will integrate key concepts such as the detailed definition of "True Commons," the requirements for "stigmergic digital environments," and the concrete use cases from Sensorica's peer production experience.

## Recent Changes

-   **Initial Documentation Scaffolding**: Established the core documentation structure and created the initial versions of all required files.

## Next Steps

1.  **Update `project-overview.md`**: Integrate the richer definition of "True Commons" and introduce "stigmergic collaboration" as a primary goal.
2.  **Update `requirements.md`**: Add the Sensorica use case and detail the requirements for a stigmergic environment (navigation, signaling, etc.).
3.  **Update `architecture.md`**: Refine the architecture to clarify the role of the `TrueCommonsResource` custom entry and its relationship with hREA.
4.  **Begin Feature Development**: Once documentation is refined, proceed with feature development based on the updated requirements and implementation plan.
